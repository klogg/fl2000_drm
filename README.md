# Linux kernel FL2000DX/IT66121FN dongle DRM driver

Clean re-implementation of FrescoLogic FL2000DX DRM driver and ITE Tech IT66121F driver, allowing to enable full display controller capabilities for [USB-to-HDMI dongles](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32821739801.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.14ee52fb8rFfu5) based on such chips in Linux

### Building driver

Check out the code and type
```
make
```
Use
```
insmod fl2000.ko && insmod it66121.ko
```
with sudo or in root shell to start the driver. If you are running on a system with secure boot enabled, you may need to sign kernel modules. Try using provided script for this:
```
./scritps/sign.sh
```
ensure that DRM components are loaded in your system, if not - please use
```
modprobe drm
modprobe drm_kms_helper
```
**NOTE:** proper kernel headers and build tools (e.g. "build-essential" package) must be installed on the system. Driver is developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with **Linux kernel 6.5.0**, so better to test it this way. Please use gcc-8 or newer to build the driver
